# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
This was a difficult CFU, we worked as a team to complete it and without the team work this could have take 3-4 times as long and I probably wouldn't have learned as much.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I am always focused but I run into walls sometimes and the breaks is a huge help.  I get up for a few minutes grab a drink or go for a quick walk.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
Everything!  This exercise had everything in it.  It was hard to figure out what to do and how to do it.  If I had all this down 100% that would be my goal going into Mod 1.
